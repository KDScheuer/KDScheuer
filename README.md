# Introduction

I have experience in both government and private sector IT. From Helpdesk Technician to Network Administrator, System Administrator, and currently a Site Reliability Engineer, I have gained exposure to many different technologies and quickly pick up new ones. I am passionate about working alongside developers to enable rapid development iterations. While I have dabbled in many facets of IT, my primary passions are automation, infrastructure, and DevOps.

# Programming Languages

- **Python:** My preferred language for scripting and automation.  
- **Bash:** Written scripts to automate SSL certificate management and perform configuration / database backups.  
- **PowerShell:** Developed scripts for administrative tasks and security operations in Windows environments.  
- **Java / C#:** Novice coder with experience in debugging and expanding features for .NET applications, as well as personal projects in Java.
